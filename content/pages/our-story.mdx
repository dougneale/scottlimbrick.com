We became best friends when we were six years old. We dreamed of working together, and had plans to ride a tandem bike to university every day. Then life got in the way. We both started working adult jobs with adult responsibilities.

It was only after Daniel got cancer and Jacob recovered from debilitating anxiety that we realised it was time to take matters into our own hands.

Mr Yes and Mr No was born.

We haven't looked back.
