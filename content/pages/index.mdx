Scott is a writer and comedian based in Melbourne. But please don’t hate him based on this – hate him because you feel it, viscerally, in response to his thoughts and deeds!

His fiction (falsehoods, lies, deceptions, etc.) has appeared or is forthcoming in *The Suburban Review, Westerly*, *Aniko Press* and *Kill Your Darlings’ New Australian Fiction 2021*. It has also been short and longlisted for the Richell Prize, *Overland*’s Fair Australia Prize, the Peter Carey Short Story Award, the KSP Writers’ Centre Short Fiction Competition, the *Big Issue* Fiction Edition, the Commonwealth Short Story Prize and other awards.

His non-fiction, essays and opinion have appeared in *Vice*, *Overland*, *The New Statesman*, *McSweeney's Internet Tendency*, Comedy Central, MTV, *Junkee*, SBS Comedy, *Meanjin*, *Voiceworks*, *Funny Ha Ha* and others.

He’s produced and presented videos for Comedy Central UK and some snippets of comedy have popped up on the BBC and ABC. His self-produced sketches and shorts have been selected for Funny or Die’s ‘Best of the Web’, Australia’s Funniest Shorts and Melbourne International Film Festival’s Powershorts. Some have even ascended to a higher plane by going viral, online.

With Rose Bishop and Lena Moon he was a main cast member of RMITV/Channel 31’s *The Leak*, a live satirical news show. With Elyce Phillips, he produces and hosts ‘Great Speeches in History’, a live character comedy series. He’s appeared or performed at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, the Emerging Writers’ Festival, the Melbourne Fringe Festival and Perth Fringe World.

Scott has a Master of Screenwriting from the VCA and other qualifications you might be surprised by given his renegade attitude and widely recognised cool-guy persona.
