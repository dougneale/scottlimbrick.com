## Bukharan Eggplant

### Ingredients

* 2 Large eggplants
* 1 Bunch of coriander leaves, washed
* 1 chilli (optional), finely chopped
* Juice of 1 lemon
* 1 Clove of garlic, crushed
* Natural oil for deep frying
* Salt and pepper

### Method

1. Cut the eggplants in half and slice widthways 2cm thick. Toss with 1 tablespoon of salt and leave in a colander between 4-8 hours. Pat dry with paper towel ready for frying.
2. Finely chop the coriander leaves and mix with the lemon, garlic and your desired amount of chilli. Add black pepper to taste but do not add salt.
3. Heat the oil in a large pot to 160 degrees celsius. Place slices of eggplant into the oil, ensuring there are no pieces overlapping. Cook until starting to brown on the bottom and flip over and cook until both sides are nicely browned. Remove eggplant and place on paper towel to cool and drain off excess oil.
4. Place eggplant into coriander mixture and season to taste. The dish can be eaten straight away but is at its best after being left overnight in the fridge.
