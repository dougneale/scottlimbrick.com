## competitions

My manuscript-in-progress, a short story collection called *Flaring Out*, was shortlisted for the [2020 Richell Prize for Emerging Writers](https://emergingwritersfestival.org.au/2020-richell-prize-for-emerging-writers-shortlist/).

Judges’ comments included: ‘With characters and settings ranging from grotesque and preposterous to heroic and prosaic, these speculative fiction short stories imbue dark humour and biting satire ... sharp, imaginative and laugh-out-loud.’

My fiction has also been recognised by:

* The Commonwealth Short Story Prize 2021 (longlisted)
* The KSP Writers’ Centre Short Fiction Competition 2020 (commended)
* The Peter Carey Short Story Award 2020 (longlisted)
